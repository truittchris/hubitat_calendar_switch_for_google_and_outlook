# Contributing

Thank you for contributing.

## Support vs contributions
- Support requests: use https://christruitt.com/support
- Bugs and feature requests: GitHub issues (unless it is a security issue)
- Code changes: pull requests

## How to contribute
- Open an issue for bugs or feature requests.
- Include versions, steps to reproduce, and logs/screenshots when applicable.
- For pull requests, keep changes focused and update README/CHANGELOG when user-facing behavior changes.

## Licensing for contributions
By submitting a pull request, you agree that your contribution is licensed under the same license as the project (inbound = outbound).

## Development notes
- Follow the project UX standards in docs/.
- Keep user-facing labels and documentation in plain language.
- Do not commit secrets. Review docs/SECURITY_AND_SECRETS.md before pushing.
- When sharing logs or screenshots, redact access tokens, refresh tokens, and client secrets.
